# Guide: OAuth

## GitHub

Read on
[`sergiodxa/remix-auth-github`](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-auth-github)
and GitHub Docs for
[Creating an OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)

Create a new OAuth App on
[Developer applications](https://github.com/settings/developers).

Get the Client ID and generate the Client Secret.

```sh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="replace_this"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="replace_this"
```

Make sure to setup the correct URLs.

- Homepage URL: <https://example.com>
- Authorization callback URL: <https://example.com/auth/github/callback>

GitHub doesn't allow to have more than 1 URI per Client ID. So just need to
create another for different environments (local, staging, production).

## Google

Read on [`remix-auth-google`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remix-auth-google)
and Google for Developer Docs for
[Using OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred)

1. Go to the
   [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) page.
2. In the
   [APIs & Services: Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   page, **Create credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
3. Select the **Web application** application type.
4. Fill in the form and click **Create**.
   - Name: The name of your OAuth 2.0 client
   - Authorized JavaScript origins:
     - <http://localhost:3000>
     - <https://example.com>
   - Authorized redirect URIs:
     - <http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback>
     - <https://example/auth/google/callback>

The redirect URIs are the endpoints to which the OAuth 2.0 server can send
responses. These endpoints must adhere to Googleâ€™s validation rules. You can
also specify URIs that refer on local such as <http://localhost:3000>.

Google allows to have more than 1 URI per Client ID. Although it might be better
to adjust for different environments (local, staging, production).

Get the Client ID and generate the Client Secret.

```sh
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="replace_this"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="replace_this"
```
