(Architecture diagram can help later on here)

- [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com)
- [Iconify](https://iconify.design)
- [Prisma ORM](https://prisma.io)
- [MySQL](https://mysql.com)
- [Docker](https://docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

## Setup

### Dependencies

Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to improve productivity and replace npm, so make sure
[pnpm is installed](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm):

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

To run the app locally, make sure the project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
pnpm install
```

This also run the `postinstall` script from `package.json` which by default run `prisma generate`.

> Note: Not using Bun yet as there are still some issues.

### Prisma Client Generation

By default installing the modules is also running the `postinstall` script that generate the Prisma
Client (`@prisma/client`) for it to be used in the app.

If it isn't generated or need to generate manually, run:

```sh
pnpm db:gen
# prisma generate
```

### Code Quality

Log, format, lint to check if the setup is fine:

```sh
pnpm check
# check: env typecheck prettier eslint stylelint prisma
```

```sh
pnpm fix
# fix: prettier eslint stylelint prisma
```

> Note: Can ignore non-critical warning from ESLint and TypeScript

### Environment Variables

Create the `.env` file from `.env.example`. This is the one for local development, not production

```sh
cp -i .env.example .env
```

Configure the required environment variables if on local, otherwise in the project settings on other
environments.

If necessary, create the `.env.production` for production access. Adjust accordingly if need for
`staging`, `test`, etc. Be careful to change the `APP_URL` on different domains and subdomains.

```sh
cp -i .env.example .env.production
```

Required:

- `APP_URL`: For example, `http://localhost:3000`
- `SESSION_SECRET`: For example, `the_secret_text`. Anything goes, but better to generate a random
  string using `openssl rand -base64 32` on the terminal or put any long random text.
- `DATABASE_URL`: For example, `mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dogokit`. Continue to read the
  Database Setup.

Optional:

- `NODE_ENV`: For example, `development`
- `*_CLIENT_ID` and `*_CLIENT_SECRET`: For OAuth related,
  [check Guide: OAuth](./docs/GUIDE_OAUTH.md)

#### Database Setup

Prisma ORM is used to communicate with the database easily.

For the database, either choose to use MySQL or PostgreSQL (relational database) from local system,
Docker container, services like [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) (MySQL) or
[Neon](https://neon.tech) (PostgreSQL).

If prefer using Docker and Docker Compose for local development,
[follow this guide on database](./docs/GUIDE_DATABASE.md).

The app is configured primarily to be deployed using PlanetScale. Because of that, the migration
files are not needed. Therefore, push the schema directly there. The migration process will be
handled through its [deploy requests](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/deploy-requests).

This repo template does not recommend MongoDB (document database), although Prisma has a stable
support for it. The database provider can still be changed, and the schema and databaase operations
might need to adapt.

#### MySQL Database with PlanetScale

To start quickly, create a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) account to have a MySQL instance
for development and production. After the database has been created, "Get the connection string",
select "Prisma", then copy the full `DATABASE_URL`.

> Keep in mind the free plan only allow for 1 database. So either later keep it, delete it when
> unused, or upgrade the plan. There's also a verification with a payment card, even though it's
> still free to start.

Also read:

- [Prisma with PlanetScale](https://prisma.io/docs/guides/database/planetscale)
- [PlanetScale with Prisma](https://planetscale.com/docs/prisma/prisma-quickstart)

### Database Operations

Sync between Prisma schema and the database directly, by making schema changes with
`prisma db push`, which can be done regularly while updating the models:

```sh
pnpm db:push
# prisma db push
```

> Note: Only need to push the schema in development. No need for migration files.

Even with local development without PlanetScale, pushing the schema directly is still okay when in
development or
[prototyping the schema](https://prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push). After a
success push, then it will automatically run `prisma generate`.

Create `users.ts` in `prisma/credentials` folder with the format below. Can focus on certain users
who want to be able to access in development, so it doesn't have to be everyone.

```ts
export const dataCredentialUsers = [
  {
    fullname: "Example",
    username: "example",
    nickname: "Dogo",
    email: "example@example.com",
    password: "exampleexample",
    roleSymbol: "ADMIN",
  },
]
```

Then seed the initial data when needed:

```sh
pnpm db:seed
# prisma db seed
```

### Build

Check if the build is fine. This als be used to build the app for production.

```sh
pnpm build
# remix build
```

This will also run `prisma generate` too before the build.

Then try to run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Then pick a host to deploy it to, such as:

- Vercel
- Netlify
- Fly.io
- Render.com
- Railway.app
- Google Cloud
- Amazon Web Services
- Microsoft Azure

If familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.
Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

### Development

Finally, develop the app while running the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
# remix dev --manual
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and it's ready!

## What's Next?

<!-- THIS IS A REMOVABLE SECTION -->

Develop the app as usual, the Remix way.

Read the [guide to codebase](./docs/GUIDE_CODEBASE.md) and [guide steps](./docs/GUIDE_STEPS.md) to
learn more about the setup.

### Change the Contents

- Arrange and remove components as needed.
- Find and replace various texts, especially the word Dogokit.

### Change Theme Colors

Use [`kiliman/shadcn-custom-theme`](https://github.com/kiliman/shadcn-custom-theme) to generate
shadcn UI CSS variables with Tailwind CSS colors.

For example:

```sh
pnpx shadcn-custom-theme primary=indigo secondary=blue accent=violet gray=neutral
```
