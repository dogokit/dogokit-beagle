- [x] Help existing Remix app development
- [x] Setup commonly used development and production parts
- [x] Provide various code and utilities
- [x] Code quality with [Prettier](https://prettier.io), [ESLint](https://eslint.org), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io), [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org)
- [x] UI components and styles with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com), bundled with [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [ ] UI for dashboard components with [Tremor](https://tremor.so)
- [x] Database with [Prisma ORM](https://prisma.io) and [MySQL](https://mysql.com) on [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)
  - Anyone can change them into [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) on [Neon](https://neon.tech) with some adjustment
- [ ] Testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)
- [ ] Commands with `dogokit` CLI or `@dogokit/cli`

## Development

From the terminal:

```sh

```

This starts the app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build the app for production:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Now need to pick a host to deploy it to, such as:

- Vercel
- Netlify
- Fly.io
- Google Cloud
- Amazon Web Services

### DIY

If familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
